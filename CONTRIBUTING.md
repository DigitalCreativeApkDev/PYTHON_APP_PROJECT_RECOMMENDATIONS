## What am I allowed to do when contributing to the repository?

1. Add your own personal Python application projects and add them to the directory based on their difficulty level 
(i.e., "Beginner Projects" for beginner, "Intermediate Projects" for intermediate, and "Advanced Projects" for 
advanced).
2. Improve the code of any existing projects in the repository and become one of the contributors of the projects.
3. Add executable files for any existing projects in the repository. For example, if project "A" in "Beginner Projects"
only has executable file for Mac OS PC, you can add an executable file for Windows PC.
4. Move a Python application project from one directory from another (e.g., "Beginner Projects" to 
"Intermediate Projects") if there are misplaced application projects.
